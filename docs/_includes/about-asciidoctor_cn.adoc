=== The Big Picture

Asciidoctor reads content written in plain text, as shown in the panel on the left in the image below, and converts it to HTML5, as shown rendered in the right panel.
Asciidoctor adds a default stylesheet to the HTML5 document, as shown, to provide a pleasant out-of-the-box experience.

=== Asciidoctor on the JVM

You can run Asciidoctor on the JVM using JRuby.
You can also use {uri-asciidoctorj}[AsciidoctorJ] to invoke Asciidoctor's APIs from Java and other JVM languages.

=== Asciidoctor.js

Asciidoctor can be used in JavaScript.
https://opalrb.com[Opal] is used to transcompile the code from Ruby to JavaScript to make {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js], which can be used wherever JavaScript runs, such as in a web browser or on Node.js.
