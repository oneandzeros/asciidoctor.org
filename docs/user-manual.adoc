This manual assumes you are using Asciidoctor to produce and convert your document.
Asciidoctor implements more syntax, attributes and functions than the legacy AsciiDoc.py processor.
<<migrating-from-asciidoc-python>> lists which features are available to the Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors.

= Introduction to Asciidoctor

include::{includedir}/about-asciidoctor_cn.adoc[]

=== Asciidoctor's Most Notable Benefits

include::{includedir}/benefits.adoc[]

==== AsciiDoc Syntax Processing

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree into a set of built-in templates to produce HTML5, PDF, DocBook 5, etc.
You have the option of writing your own converter or providing {uri-tilt}[Tilt]-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce alternative formats.

NOTE: Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python processor (`asciidoc.py`).
The Asciidoctor test suite has > 1,500 tests to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.

In addition to the standard AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., [x-]`icon:fire[]`) and UI elements (e.g., [x-]`btn:[Save]`).
Asciidoctor also offers a modern, responsive theme based on {uri-foundation}[Foundation] to style the HTML5 output.

= Terms and Concepts

[partintro]
--
All of the content in an Asciidoctor document, including lines of text, predefined styles, and processing commands, is classified as either a block or an inline element.
Within each of these elements are an array of styles, options, and functions that can be applied to your content.

This section will provide you with an overview of what each of these elements and sub-elements are and the basic syntax and rules for using them.

==== Style

==== Id

include::{includedir}/attr-style.adoc[tag=id]

===== Block Assignment

include::{includedir}/attr-style.adoc[tag=bl]

===== Inline Assignment

include::{includedir}/attr-style.adoc[tag=in]

==== Role

An element can be assigned numerous roles.

===== Block Assignment

In an attribute list, there are two ways to assign a role attribute to a block element.

. Prefixing the name with a dot (`.`).
. Specifying the name with `role=<name>`.

[source]
----
[.summary]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

[source]
----
[role="summary"]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

To specify multiple roles using the shorthand syntax, separate them by dots.

[source]
----
[.summary.incremental]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

[source]
----
[role="summary,incremental"]
* Review 1
* Review 2
----

===== Inline Assignment

The role (`.`) shorthand can be used on inline quoted text.

.Quoted text with role assignments using traditional AsciiDoc syntax
[source]
----
[big goal]*free the world*
----

.Quoted text with role assignments using Asciidoctor shorthand
[source]
----
[.big.goal]*free the world*
----

TIP: The attribute list preceding formatted text can be escaped using a backslash (e.g., `+\[role]*bold*+`).
In this case, the text will still be formatted, but the attribute list will be unescaped and output verbatim.

.Role-playing for text enclosed in backticks
To align with other formatted (i.e., quoted) text in AsciiDoc, roles can now be assigned to text enclosed in backticks.

Given:

```
[.rolename]`monospace text`
```

the following HTML is produced:

```html
<code class="rolename">monospace text</code>
```

Using the shorthand notation, an id (i.e., anchor) can also be specified:

```
[#idname.rolename]`monospace text`
```

which produces:

```html
<a id="idname"></a><code class="rolename">monospace text</code>
```

==== Options

The options attribute is a versatile named attribute that can contain a comma separated list of values.

It can also be defined globally with an attribute entry.

===== Block Assignment

In an attribute list, there are three ways to assign an options attribute to a block element.

. Prefixing the value with a percent sign (`%`).
. Specifying the value with `opts=<name>`
. Specifying the value with `options=<name>`.

Consider a table block with the three option values `header`, `footer`, and `autowidth`.

Here's how the options are assigned to the table using the shorthand notation (`%`).

.Shorthand Asciidoctor syntax
[source]
----
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
| Cell A | Cell B
|===
----

Here's how the options are assigned to the table using `options`.

.Traditional AsciiDoc syntax
[source]
----
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
| Cell A | Cell B
|===
----

Let's consider the options when combined with other attributes.

.Shorthand Asciidoctor block syntax
[source]
----
[horizontal.properties%step]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----

.Traditional AsciiDoc block syntax
[source]
----
[horizontal, role="properties", options="step"]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
----

=== Assigning Document Attributes Inline

Document attributes can be assigned using the following syntax:

 {set:<attrname>[!][:<value>]}

For example:

[source]
{set:sourcedir:src/main/java}

is effectively the same as:

 :sourcedir: src/main/java

This is important for being able to assign document attributes in places where attribute entry lines are not normally processed, such as in a table cell.

[#xref]
== Cross References

A link to another location within the current AsciiDoc document or in another AsciiDoc document is called a [.term]_cross reference_ (also referred to as an _xref_).
To create a cross reference, you first need to define the location where the reference will point (i.e., the anchor).
Then, you need to use one of the forms of the inline xref macro to create a reference to that location.
From there, you can customize the text of the reference in various ways.

=== Automatic Anchors

It's important to understand that many anchors are already defined for you.
Using default settings, Asciidoctor automatically creates an anchor for every section and discrete heading.
It does so by generating an ID for that section (or discrete heading) and registering that ID in the references catalog.
You can then use that ID as the target of an cross reference.

For example, considering the following section.

[source]
----
= Section Title
----

Asciidoctor automatically assigns the ID `_section_title` to this section, which you can then use as the target of an xref to create a reference to this section.
You can also customize how this ID is generated.
Refer to <<auto-generated-ids>> for more information about how Asciidoctor generates these IDs.

If you're referring to a content element other than a section, you'll need to define an anchor on that element explicitly.
Read on to learn how.

When you're using passthroughs inside literal and listing blocks, it can be easy to forget that the triple-plus, double-dollar, and backtick passthroughs are macros (not quotes).
If you want to enable the passthroughs, make sure to assign the `macros` value to the `subs` attribute.

== PDFs

Conversion from AsciiDoc to PDF is made possible by a number of tools.

{uri-asciidoctor-pdf}[Asciidoctor PDF]::
A native PDF converter for Asciidoctor (converts directly from AsciiDoc to PDF using Prawn).
+
Instructions for installing and using Asciidoctor PDF are documented in the project's {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-readme}[README].
The tool provides built-in theming via a YAML configuration file, which is documented in the {uri-asciidoctor-pdf-theming-guide}[theming guide].
+
TIP: Asciidoctor PDF is the preferred tool for converting to PDF and is fully supported by the Asciidoctor community.

a2x::
A DocBook toolchain frontend provided by that AsciiDoc Python project.
+
To use this tool, you should first convert to DocBook using Asciidoctor, then convert the DocBook to PDF using a2x.
a2x accepts a DocBook file as input and can convert it to a PDF using either Apache FOP or dblatex.
Instructions for using a2x are documented in the project's {uri-a2x-manpage}[man page].

{fopub-ref}[asciidoctor-fopub]::
A DocBook toolchain frontend similar to a2x, but which only requires Java to be installed on your machine.
+
Instructions for using asciidoctor-fopub are documented in the project's {fopub-doc-ref}[README].
To alter the look and feel of the PDF, it's necessary to pass XSL parameters or modify the XSLT.
More information about customization can be found in http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/[DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide].

== Preview Your Content

=== Guard/Live Viewer

Guard::
AsciiDoc is a plugin for https://github.com/guard/guard[Guard] that converts watched AsciiDoc files to the specified output format whenever they change using Asciidoctor.

Instructions for using the Guard/Live viewer are documented in the project's {guard-doc-ref}[README].

== CLI Inputs and Outputs

So far, you've seen how to pass a single input file to the CLI for it to convert.
You can also convert multiple files at once, read content from STDIN, write content to STDOUT, or write content to a different output file or directory.
This section explains the various input and output options of the CLI.

=== Process Multiple Source Files from the CLI

include::{includedir}/process-multi.adoc[]

=== Specifying an Output File

include::{includedir}/file-output.adoc[]

=== Piping Content Through the CLI

include::{includedir}/io-piping.adoc[]

== Running Asciidoctor Securely

include::{includedir}/secure.adoc[]

=== Set the Safe Mode in the CLI

= Customizing Your Output

[partintro]
--
Asciidoctor provides a default stylesheet and built-in converters so you can quickly process and convert your document, but it also lets you use custom stylesheets and converters.
The Asciidoctor project includes alternative stylesheet themes from <<stylesheet-factory,the stylesheet factory>> and <<slide-decks,specialized backends>>.
You can also create your own <<custom-themes,themes>> and <<custom-backends,backends>>.

=== External Preview

include::{includedir}/factory-preview.adoc[]

== Slide Decks

In addition to generating normal documents from AsciiDoc (e.g., a book or article), you can also use AsciiDoc to create HTML-based slide decks.
The converters for creating HTML-based slides add some additional structure rules to the document for defining slides.
However, nothing in this structure restricts you from still being able to publish the content as a normal document too.

The conversion from AsciiDoc to an HTML-based slide deck is handled by one of the following converters from the Asciidoctor ecosystem:

* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js[Asciidoctor Reveal.js] -- Converts an AsciiDoc document into a Reveal.js presentation
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bespoke[Asciidoctor Bespoke] -- Converts an AsciiDoc document into a Bespoke presentation

There's also a converter for making deck.js slide decks, but we discourage using it as deck.js itself is very outdated.

== Custom Backends

//=== Creating a Backend

=== Storing Multiple Templates

Custom templates can be stored in multiple directories.
That means you can build on an existing backend by copying only the templates you want to modify.
Then, just pass both the directory holding the original templates and the directory containing your customized templates when you invoke Asciidoctor.

In the CLI, multiple template directories are specified by using the `-T` option multiple times.

 $ asciidoctor -T /path/to/original/templates -T /path/to/modified/templates mysample.adoc

In the API, multiple template directories are specified by passing an array to the `template_dirs` option:

```ruby
Asciidoctor.convert_file 'mysample.adoc', safe: :safe
    template_dirs: %w(/path/to/original/templates /path/to/modified/templates)
```

= Conversions and Migrations

[partintro]
--
In this part, you'll learn how to migrate documents written in other documentation languages to AsciiDoc.
We'll start with the simplest migration, switching from AsciiDoc Python, the original implementation of AsciiDoc, to Asciidoctor, the modern implementation.
We'll then cover how to move to AsciiDoc from other documentation languages like DocBook, Markdown and HTML.
In addition to differences in the syntax, many of the sections also suggest tools you can use to ease the migration.

== Convert DocBook XML to AsciiDoc

include::{includedir}/docbookrx.adoc[]

== Convert Markdown to AsciiDoc

{adr} recognizes a fair amount of Markdown syntax, thus allowing you to migrate from Markdown to AsciiDoc gradually.
See {uri-home}/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#markdown-compatibility[Markdown Compatibility] to learn what syntax is shared.
The syntax you must change is listed in <<asciidoc-vs-markdown>>.

[glossary]
== Glossary

[glossary]
admonition:: a callout paragraph or block that has a label or icon indicating its priority.

backend:: a moniker for the expected output format; used as a key to select which converter to use; often used interchangeably with the name of a converter (i.e., the "html5" backend").

block attribute:: an attribute associated with a delimited block or paragraph; these attributes can affect processing of the block, and are available to block processors, but cannot be referenced using an attribute reference.

built-in attribute:: a document attribute that controls processing, integrations, styling, and localization.

cross reference:: a link from one location in the document to another location marked by an anchor.

document attribute:: an attribute associated with the document (node); in other words, an attribute in the global document attributes dictionary; the value of these attributes can be referenced using an attribute reference; if defined in the header, the document attribute is known as a header attribute.

environment attribute:: a dynamic document attribute that pertains to, or gives information about, the runtime environment.

header attribute:: a document attribute defined in the document header; visible from all nodes in the document; often required for global settings such as the source highlighter or icons mode.

list continuation:: a plus sign (`+`) on a line by itself that connects adjacent lines of text to a list item.

macro attribute:: an attribute associated with a block or inline macro; these attributes can affect processing of the macro, and are available to macro processors, but cannot be referenced using an attribute reference.

predefined attribute:: a document attribute defined for convenience; often used for inserting special content characters.

quoted text:: text which is enclosed in special punctuation to give it emphasis or special meaning.

user-defined attribute:: a document attribute defined by the content author; used for storing reusable content, and controlling conditional inclusion.
